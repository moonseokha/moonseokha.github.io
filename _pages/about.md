I am currently an M.S./Ph.D. Integrated Student, advised by Prof. Jinkyu Kim since 2022. Before joining the [Vision & AI lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) at Korea University, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University. My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, particularly autonomous robots and autonomous driving. Recently, I have been focusing on camera-based perception tasks in autonomous driving, including 3D detection and occupancy prediction. I also explored trajectory prediction with an emphasis on modeling interactions between agents, using vision-driven text guidance as supervision to inform the model of relevant contextual cues needed to understand each agentâ€™s situation. Currently, I am particularly interested in Vision-Language-Navigation for autonomous robots and end-to-end learning frameworks for autonomous driving.
