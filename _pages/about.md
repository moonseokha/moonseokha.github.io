I am a M.S./Ph.D Integrated Student under the advisement of Prof. Jinkyu Kim since 2022. Prior to joining [Vision & AI lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) in Korea University, I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Yonsei University. I am interested in the field of Computer Vision, with a focus on autonomous robots and autonomous driving. Currently, I am focused on 3D object detection using surround-view images, trajectory prediction, and advancements in robotics.
