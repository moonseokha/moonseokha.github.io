Hi!ðŸ˜€ I'm a Ph.D. Student at Korea University, [Vision & AI lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) (Advisor: Prof. Jinkyu Kim). I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University. 

My research interests lie in the field of Autonomous Robots ðŸ¤– and Autonomous Driving ðŸš—. Recently, I have been focusing on camera-based perception tasks in autonomous driving, including 3D detection and occupancy prediction. I also explored trajectory prediction with an emphasis on modeling interactions between agents, using vision-driven text guidance as supervision to inform the model of relevant contextual cues needed to understand each agentâ€™s situation. 

Currently, I am particularly interested in Vision-Language Navigation for autonomous robots and End-to-End frameworks for autonomous driving.
